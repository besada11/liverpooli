                    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span> Liverpool</span></b> is a city in North West England, United Kingdom with a population of about 485,000 in 2015.[2] It is part of the Liverpool-Birkenhead metropolitan area, the fifth-largest metropolitan area in the UK. The local government is Liverpool City Council.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Liverpool is on the eastern side of the River Mersey. It used to lie in the old area of West Derby in the south west of Lancashire. It became a borough in 1207 and a city in 1880. In 1889, it became separate from Lancashire. Liverpool's growth as a large port was matched by the growth of the city during the Industrial Revolution.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It was most famous as a port during the late 19th and early 20th century. It is the birthplace of the famous rock group The Beatles. It is also famous because of its football teams, Everton F.C. and Liverpool F.C.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">People from Liverpool are called Liverpudlians or Scousers. People from Birkenhead are called "true Scousers" by some.

                <p>Liverpool became very important due to trade in sugar, tobacco and especially slaves.[3] In 1818, the Black Ball Line, with a fleet of sailing ships, offered the first regular passenger service with emphasis on passenger comfort, from England to the United States.
        
                In the 19th Century, transatlantic trade and passenger travel was served to destinations such as New York City from Liverpool by:
              </p>
              <ul>
                 <li>Black Ball Line (trans-Atlantic packet) (1817–1877)</li>
                 <li>Cunard Line (1840–)</li>
                 <li> White Star Line (1845–1934)</li>
                 <li>Collins Line (1818–1858)</li>
                 <li>Leyland Line (1873–1901)</li>
                 <li>Guion Line (1866–1894)</li>
                 <li>Inman Line (1850–1893)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In 1830, Liverpool and Manchester became the first cities to have a railway connecting them to each other, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Not including airports in London, Liverpool Airport was the first airport in Britain opening in 1930. In 2008 it was awarded the title European Capital of Culture.
